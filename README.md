## Project Overview

This repository contains a full exploratory data analysis of **life expectancy at birth** from 1950 to 2023, based on the high-quality dataset from **Our World in Data** (sources: Human Mortality Database, UN World Population Prospects, Riley, Zijdeman et al.).

The project is divided into two main analyses:

1. **Global Analysis** – Worldwide progress, catch-up effect, health shocks (HIV/AIDS, COVID-19), convergence between countries  
2. **Italy Deep Dive** – Italy’s performance compared to Western Europe, G7, Americas, Mediterranean countries, BRICS+, and the world


## Key Findings ([Complete results here](results/readme.md))

### Global Trends
- World life expectancy rose from **46.4 years (1950)** to **73.2 years (2023)** → **+26.8 years**
- ![World & Continents Evolution](results/img/global_evolution.png)
- Biggest gain: **South Korea** (+62 years)
- ![Top 15 Biggest Gains](results/img/top15_increase.png)
- Sub-Saharan Africa is the only major region still lagging (HIV/AIDS setback 1990–2005 clearly visible)
- ![aa](results/img/hiv%africa.png)
- The Great Chinese Famine (1959–61) and COVID-19 (2020-2021) caused the major global drop since 1950.

### Italy
- From **63.7 years (1950)** to **83.7 years (2023)** → **+20 years**
- Consistently among the **top 7–8 countries worldwide** in 2023
- Outperforms G7 average by **+2.4 years**, Eastern Europe and BRICS+ by **10–12 years**
- ![Italy vs International Groups](results/img/italy_comparison_main.png)
- One of the most resilient Western countries during COVID-19
