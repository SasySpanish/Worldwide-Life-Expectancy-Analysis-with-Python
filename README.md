## Project Overview

This repository contains a full exploratory data analysis of **life expectancy at birth** from 1950 to 2023, based on the high-quality dataset from **Our World in Data** (sources: Human Mortality Database, UN World Population Prospects, Riley, Zijdeman et al.).

The project is divided into two main analyses:

1. **Global Analysis** – Worldwide progress, catch-up effect, health shocks (HIV/AIDS, COVID-19), convergence between countries  
2. **Italy Deep Dive** – Italy’s performance compared to Western Europe, G7, Americas, Mediterranean countries, BRICS+, and the world

All charts are automatically generated and saved in `results/img/`.

## Key Findings

### Global Trends
- World life expectancy rose from **46.4 years (1950)** to **73.2 years (2023)** → **+26.8 years**
- Biggest gain: **South Korea** (+62 years)
- Sub-Saharan Africa is the only major region still lagging (HIV/AIDS setback 1990–2005 clearly visible)
- COVID-19 caused the first global drop since 1950, fully recovered by 2022–2023

### Italy
- From **63.7 years (1950)** to **83.7 years (2023)** → **+20 years**
- Consistently among the **top 7–8 countries worldwide** in 2023
- Outperforms G7 average by **+2.4 years**, Eastern Europe and BRICS+ by **10–12 years**
- One of the most resilient Western countries during COVID-19

## How to Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/life-expectancy-analysis.git
cd life-expectancy-analysis

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the full analysis
python src/main.py
```

All plots will be saved automatically in `results/img/`.
